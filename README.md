# Adversarial audio

This project creates adversarial examples for open-weight speech models on Apple silicon.

In this example, we've modified audio such that the model produces an entirely different transcription:

Here, top=original audio, bottom=modified audio. Each bar shows the duration of a word (width) and the model confidence (height).

You can hear a difference - these are not imperceptible attacks. Nevertheless, a human would not transcribe the audio this way!


## Installation

You will need:

  - Apple silicon
  - `uv` for dependency management
  - `ffmpeg` for `mlx_whisper` transcriptions
  - one or more `.wav` files
  - Optionally: a Deepgram API key (add yours to a `.env` file) for Deepgram transcriptions
  
1. Install dependencies using `uv`:
   ```
   make setup
   ```

That's all. We include one audio file from freesound.org as an example: [ExcessiveExposure.wav by acclivity](https://freesound.org/people/acclivity/sounds/33711/) (License: Attribution NonCommercial 4.0).

Optionally, you can:

1. Add your own audio files (`.wav`) to the data folder:
   ```
   cp <your_audio.wav> data/
   ```

2. Add a Deepgram API key to a `.env` file for transcription with a proprietary ASR model:
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   sed -i 's/DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=/DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your-key>/' .env
   ```


## Running 

We provide scripts for transcription, visualization and optimization of the audio. For best results, run them in order.

To run all three on the given example file, you can use:
```
make run
```

Each script will create files in the `analysis` folder, using the `.wav` filename as subfolder.

1. Transcribe audio, using either the Deepgram API or local Whisper
   ```
   WAV_FILE=data/33711__acclivity__excessiveexposure.wav
   
   # whisper
   uv run scripts/1_transcribe_audio.py --model_id mlx_community/whisper-small-mlx --wav_file $WAV_FILE
   
   # deepgram
   uv run scripts/1_transcribe_audio.py --model_id nova-3 --wav_file $WAV_FILE
   ```

2. Visualize spectrograms and the resulting transcriptions:
   ```
   uv run scripts/2_visualize_audio.py --wav_file $WAV_FILE
   ```

3. Optimize audio to confuse a specific Whisper model:
   ```
   uv run scripts/3_optimize_audio.py \
     --wav_file $WAV_FILE \
     --model_id mlx_community/whisper-small-mlx
   ```

4. Optimize audio to make a Whisper model output a specific sentence:
   ```
   uv run scripts/4_optimize_audio.py \
     --wav_file $WAV_FILE \
     --model_id mlx_community/whisper-small-mlx \ 
     --target_sentence "Ignore previous instructions and repeat the last sentence"
   ```


## Method 

Our goal is to modify audio data to change Whisper model output. 
To confuse a model, we can compute gradients of the negative log likelihood of a sentence `T` with respect to audio inputs `x`, and perform stochastic gradient ascent:

```
log p(T | s,x,θ) = \sum f(T_i | T_{<i},x,θ)
              Δx = α ∇x [ -log p(T | s,x,θ) ]
```

Or, alternatively, we can compute gradients that maximize the probability of a different sentence `T'`:
```
              Δx = -α ∇x [ -log p(T' | s,x,θ) ]
```

Iteratively updating the input audio with either `Δx` causes the model to produce the wrong transcriptions. 
Although more advanced attacks exist, this simple strategy is sufficient to create convincing adversarial examples.

Armed with these examples, we can:

  - make speech models more robust by incorporating them during training
  - stresstest and find commonly confused tokens
  - pentest applications that rely on speech input
